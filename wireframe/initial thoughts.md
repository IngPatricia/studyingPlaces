**Description**

  The initial idea for this project is to have at least 6 *studyingSpots* around the city/university as an image that can be clicked. 
Upon clicking another page opens with the place details and its location on google maps. There is a *FAQ* page where the user can interact by clicking on the question under interest. Additionally there is a *About me* page with a small description about me & this project where the user can play a game too! 

**Tech used** 

  For the wireframing and inital prototyping I used **Figma**

Initially it looked like this:
